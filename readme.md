Allows you to create presentations with the WordPress block editor.

## Description

Requires the latest [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) release!

Report issues, or collaborate, on [Github](https://github.com/ellatrix/slides/issues).

* Creates a custom post type "Presentation", which will render as a presentation on the front end using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).
* Enables the block editor with a "Slide" block, which can be used as a container for each slide in the presentation.
* Currently the styling options are limited, but you can add your own CSS rules.
* You import a font by adding e.g. `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=...');` above any other rules.
* You can also set a background color for individual slides!
* It's possible to include some notes with every slide.
* More options coming soon!
